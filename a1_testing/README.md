# Use the GNU Util diff to Test

`diff` will allow you to compare the output of your programs with eachother or other programs. For example in A1, compare your sort.sh with the output of the actual sort program. ;)

**Try running these:**

./diff_example.sh same1.sh same2.sh 

./diff_example.sh same1.sh different.sh
