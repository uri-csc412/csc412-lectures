# mutexes!

Do you ever need to protect something to ensure only 1 person uses it at a time? Imagine you are in a group assignment with 4 people and there is only 1 computer? How do you take turns? Well mutexes allow to explicitly protect areas of your code from simultaneous access by threads. This might come in handy if you need to share memory between threads.
